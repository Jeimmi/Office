# Office
In this lab, you will extend the office example from lecture to better re ect the scenario of students
waiting for help at o ce hours. You will expand the communication protocol to keep track of the order 
that students attempt to enter a full room (forming a line outside the room), and will only admit students 
into the room if they are at the front of the line. Students will also  ask  the instructor for help, which 
occupies the instructor's time and makes him/her unable to  help  other students at the same time. Students 
can still leave and enter the room while one student is being helped.
